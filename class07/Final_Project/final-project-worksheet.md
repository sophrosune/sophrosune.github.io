| Site Url        | Desired Features           | 
| ------------- |-------------| 
| [Common Brand](brand.common.com)| - need to match our branding and that sidebar action as I want to build a page we actually use!|  
| [CodePen by Nate Wiley](https://codepen.io/Hadsterific/pen/boOqvw)| I'd like this to be the hard mode of my game. |   
| [CodePen by Mike Wood](https://codepen.io/petrarque/full/JWapzj/)| Another idea for my game, drag n drop.|   
| [CareOf Survey](https://takecareof.com/survey/new?question=first_name) | This is a really cool interactive survey I'd love to integrate sometime in the future if I'm able to tackle the rest of this. |

## MVP 

1. A page for team members to make onboarding more fun that is easy for me to update as new team members join or info is changed.

2. Landing Page linking to Who's Who game, Resources folders in Google Drive, and Brand page.

3. Who's Who game:

Version 1: photo to list matching of all team members, face up
Version 2: photo to list matching of selected team (e.g. only the Real Estate team, only the HW team, only the remote team...), face up
Version 3: shuffling!
Version 4: Memory version (face down)
Version 5: different photos of team members

## POST MVP

Who's Who game scoreboard, timer, levels, machine learning what photos look similar and making the game harder?

Who's Who audio game (person's voice saying "Hi, nice to meet you" matched to their name or face)

Privacy- only team members can log in and place

Interactive Survey for onboarding instead of the google form we currently use to obtain info.

Interactive Map displaying all our homes

Home version of Who's Who (match photos of a home to its name)
